## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This project was a good opportunity to explore topics that I wanted to delve into personally. I originally wanted to scrape a website, but had trouble coming up with an idea that was both feasible and interesting so I opted to instead use the census API. I have had experience with the API in R, but never in making an end-end mapping project, at most I have used the API to create tables or to merge with an existing shapefile. For my work, a tool like what I had made for this project would actually be helpful to me which is why I decided it would be a good fit for my project. Working with the census API was a bit challenging since it is not in the same format that I am used to in R. I researched it throughout my project but overall struggled to accomplish my goals with the mapping project. Ideally I would give the user the option to select multiple variables or whole tables, but was unable to accomplish this while also ensuring my Streamlit UI worked smoothly. If I had more time I would become more familiar with the census API and Streamlit programming. I also worked on both aspects of my project simultaneously once I had gotten the API call to work initially which was not the best course of action. I should have built out my API call and data pipeline first that way it would have been less of a headache to make my UI since I had to adjust it a few times throughout my project. It would have been wise to map out features I planned to include more.
